# legacy-rust-syntax

This extension snapshots the Rust syntax highlighting that shipped with
Visual Studio Code in late 2020.

At the time, a pull request was in progress ([microsoft/vscode#108254]) that
updates the Rust grammar to be more capable and highlight more tokens. As noble
as this goal is, I personally find the new grammar to be "too good", as it
results in too many tokens being colorized.
